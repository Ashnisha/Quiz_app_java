Alright, let's break this down in a way your managee can easily understand:
Imagine this function is like a waiter in a restaurant.
 * "Hey Waiter, Get the Counts!" ( function getCounts(navs) ): We're telling the waiter ("getCounts" function) to go fetch some numbers (counts) for us. We might also give the waiter a list of tables to check ("navs").
 * "Go to this Specific Table (URL) and Ask for the Menu Count" ( const url = API_URLS.GET_ALL_COUNTS; ): The waiter knows exactly where to go.  API_URLS.GET_ALL_COUNTS is like the table number or specific location in the restaurant where the menu counts are kept.
 * "Take this Order and Ask Politely (Axios)" ( axios(url, getReqHeader()) ): We're using a tool called "Axios" to help the waiter. Think of Axios as a polite way to send the order to the kitchen. getReqHeader() is like giving the waiter special instructions on how to ask nicely (like using the right words or showing a special card).
 * "If You Get the Counts, Update the Board!" ( .then((res) => { ... }) ): If the waiter successfully gets the counts from the kitchen (the server), we want them to update the display board (the UI) with the numbers they got.
   * res is like the waiter bringing back the information.
   * setCounts and updateCount are like telling the waiter where to write the numbers on the display board.
 * "If There's a Problem, Tell Me!" ( .catch((err) => { ... }) ): If the waiter can't get the counts (like if the kitchen is closed or there's a mistake), we want them to tell us what went wrong.
Possible Problems and Solutions:
 * Wrong Table Number (Incorrect URL): The waiter might go to the wrong table and get nothing.  Solution: Double-check the table number (URL) is correct.
 * Bad Manners (Invalid Headers): The waiter might not ask politely, and the kitchen might ignore them. Solution: Make sure the waiter knows the right way to ask (headers).
 * The Menu Changed (Incorrect Data Structure): The waiter might bring back the information in a different format than we expected. Solution: Ask the waiter to show us exactly what they brought back (log the response) and check the kitchen's menu (server documentation).
 * The Display Board is Broken (Issue with setCounts or updateCount): The waiter might have the numbers, but can't write them on the board. Solution: Check the display board (React component) to see if it's working correctly.
 * The Restaurant is Closed (Network Issues): The waiter might not be able to reach the kitchen at all. Solution: Check if the restaurant is open (check network connection).
In essence, this code is about fetching data from a server (like getting information from a kitchen) and updating the display (the UI) with that data. We need to make sure the waiter has the right instructions and that everything is working smoothly.
