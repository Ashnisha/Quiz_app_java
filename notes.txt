Alright, let's break this down in a way your managee can easily understand:
Imagine this function is like a waiter in a restaurant.
 * "Hey Waiter, Get the Counts!" ( function getCounts(navs) ): We're telling the waiter ("getCounts" function) to go fetch some numbers (counts) for us. We might also give the waiter a list of tables to check ("navs").
 * "Go to this Specific Table (URL) and Ask for the Menu Count" ( const url = API_URLS.GET_ALL_COUNTS; ): The waiter knows exactly where to go.  API_URLS.GET_ALL_COUNTS is like the table number or specific location in the restaurant where the menu counts are kept.
 * "Take this Order and Ask Politely (Axios)" ( axios(url, getReqHeader()) ): We're using a tool called "Axios" to help the waiter. Think of Axios as a polite way to send the order to the kitchen. getReqHeader() is like giving the waiter special instructions on how to ask nicely (like using the right words or showing a special card).
 * "If You Get the Counts, Update the Board!" ( .then((res) => { ... }) ): If the waiter successfully gets the counts from the kitchen (the server), we want them to update the display board (the UI) with the numbers they got.
   * res is like the waiter bringing back the information.
   * setCounts and updateCount are like telling the waiter where to write the numbers on the display board.
 * "If There's a Problem, Tell Me!" ( .catch((err) => { ... }) ): If the waiter can't get the counts (like if the kitchen is closed or there's a mistake), we want them to tell us what went wrong.
Possible Problems and Solutions:
 * Wrong Table Number (Incorrect URL): The waiter might go to the wrong table and get nothing.  Solution: Double-check the table number (URL) is correct.
 * Bad Manners (Invalid Headers): The waiter might not ask politely, and the kitchen might ignore them. Solution: Make sure the waiter knows the right way to ask (headers).
 * The Menu Changed (Incorrect Data Structure): The waiter might bring back the information in a different format than we expected. Solution: Ask the waiter to show us exactly what they brought back (log the response) and check the kitchen's menu (server documentation).
 * The Display Board is Broken (Issue with setCounts or updateCount): The waiter might have the numbers, but can't write them on the board. Solution: Check the display board (React component) to see if it's working correctly.
 * The Restaurant is Closed (Network Issues): The waiter might not be able to reach the kitchen at all. Solution: Check if the restaurant is open (check network connection).
In essence, this code is about fetching data from a server (like getting information from a kitchen) and updating the display (the UI) with that data. We need to make sure the waiter has the right instructions and that everything is working smoothly.

NEW ONE 

Let's break down line number 36:
GET_FEED_CONFIG: `${API_URL}/core/getFeedConfig`,

Understanding the Line
 * GET_FEED_CONFIG:: This is a key in a JavaScript object named API_URLS. It acts as a label or identifier for the value associated with it.
 * ${API_URL}/core/getFeedConfig: This is the value assigned to the GET_FEED_CONFIG key. It represents a string that forms a URL.
   * ${API_URL}: This is a template literal (indicated by the backticks ``). Inside the template literal, ${API_URL} is a placeholder that will be replaced with the actual value of the API_URL variable.  We can assume that API_URL is defined elsewhere in your code (likely near the top of the file or in a configuration file) and holds the base URL of your API.
   * /core/getFeedConfig: This is a string literal that represents the specific path or endpoint for the getFeedConfig API within your application's core API.
In Simple Terms:
Line 36 defines a URL for fetching configuration data related to "feeds" in your application.  It constructs the complete URL by combining the base API URL (stored in API_URL) with the specific endpoint /core/getFeedConfig.
Why is it Called in the Core Info Page?
The fact that this API (getFeedConfig) is called in the core info page suggests that the core info page needs to display or use some configuration information related to feeds.
Possible Scenarios:
 * Displaying Feed Settings: The core info page might be showing users the current configuration settings for how feeds are processed or displayed in the application.
 * Initializing Feed Functionality: The core info page might be fetching the feed configuration when it loads to initialize certain feed-related features or components.
 * Debugging or Admin Tools: The core info page might be used by administrators or developers to view or modify feed configurations for debugging or maintenance purposes.
Example:
Let's say API_URL is defined as https://my-api.example.com. Then, line 36 would effectively create the following URL:
https://my-api.example.com/core/getFeedConfig

This URL would be used by your application (using axios or fetch) to make an HTTP request to the server to retrieve the feed configuration data.
In summary, line 36 defines the endpoint for fetching feed configuration data, and its presence in the core info page indicates that this page relies on that configuration for its functionality.
