Here's the flow of API calls along with UI actions and error handling in the format you requested:

---

**START**  
‚Üì  
**User Action: Creates Feed**  
- The user initiates an action to create a feed.  
‚Üì  
**Core Info Page Loads**  
- The Core Info Page UI starts loading.  
‚Üì  
**APIs Triggered for Core Info Page**  
- `getOverallCountInfo`  
- `getFeedConfigFeedSequence`  
- `getFeedConnectorImages`  
‚Üì  
**API Responses Processed**  
- The API responses are received and processed.  
- The UI updates based on the received data.  
‚Üì  
**Error Handling**  
- If an API request fails, check and debug in:  
  - **`getCounts` function in `index.js`** (for `getOverallCountInfo`)  
  - **`apiUtils.js` or `sideNavigation.js`** (for API request configurations)  
  - **Check Console Logs (`console.log(err)`)** for debugging issues.  
- Possible fixes:  
  - Ensure correct API URLs in `API_URLS` object.  
  - Verify API request headers and parameters.  
  - Handle empty or undefined responses in UI logic (`menuCountInfo[0]`).  
‚Üì  
**Final UI Updates**  
- If data is valid, `setCounts` and `updateCount` update the UI.  
- If there are errors, an appropriate fallback or error message is shown.

This structured flow should help you understand API calls and UI updates, along with where to debug errors if they occur. Let me know if you need modifications!
